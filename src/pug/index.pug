                                .d Kafka clusters at Agoda collectively observe a trillion messages every day; an auditing system runs on Docker swarm. Hardware/software failures and scheduled maintenance are part of our day to day operations. I initiated the process and helped the team to automate maintenance activities using Ansible, AWX and Slack.

To ensure all possible touch points are captured; we have our own web analytics tracker and a data collector. As number clients increased; the response time of data collector went beyond SLA limits. I re-wrote the legacy program in Golang and deployed in multiple regions to keep TTFB less than 50ms.

                                .d Important part of my work at Datalicious was to design, implement and scale data pipelines for OptimaHub. The pipeline processes user touchpoint data for analysis and insight using Apache Beam running on Google Dataflow. Data pipelines for the product are modular and re-usable. We utilize configuration files and a schema repository to process data from different clients.
